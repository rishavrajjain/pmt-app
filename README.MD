## How we built it
- We used MLOps to create a pipeline for our model.
- We imported the data,cleaned it , transformed it and trained it.
- After this we serve our model 
- We call the API from our UI to get the vulnerability level of the household based on input parameters


## Accomplishments we are proud of 
- Building a complete MLOps pipeline
- Building a UI to test it and present it and show real life implementation
